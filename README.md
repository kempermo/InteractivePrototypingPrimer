# Interactive Prototyping Primer
This repository serves as a short introduction to interactive prototyping. We will discuss some aspects about interactivity before getting our hands dirty and start to solder and program.

## Schedule:
Day 1:
* 14:00 Lab Tour and demostration of projects
* 14:30 Introduction to Interactivity
* 15:00 Workshop: Sensing the World and Acting on it 
* 17:00 WrapUp 

Day 2:
* 09:00 Free work
* 11:00 Mentoring
* 12:00 WrapUp

## Introduction
In the history of Interaction Design there have been multiple definitions of what exactly an interactive system is and does. Basically what all these definitions have in common is the notion that interaction is an ongoing process of acting and perceiving and an interactive system has to fit in this loop of interaction. This doesn't mean that an interactive system has to incorporate any digital technological components but today interactive systems most of the time have or aqcuire at least one digital aspect.

The variety of available technology today offers a lot of opportunities for creating astonishing products and interfaces. At the same time it could be hard to navigate through this glut of technology if you are a designer and not the crazy tech guy. Even more we as designers have – to a certain extend – the responsibility to be critical with all the shiny digital technology and need to advocate meaningful application in order to create meaningful products.

To take this responsibility it is necessary to know about the possibilities and boundaries of technology. We don't have to become perfect electrical engineers, programmers or scientists, but we need to have a profound interest and some skills to build, prototype and test interactions that really bring benefit to the people who are using it.

This is the point where we want to start with out primer. It's about creating an understanding for technology. What are the basic components and how could we make use of them? How can I program a microcontroler and what can it do for me? These and many more wuestions we will answer during our session.
